# “He Said, She Said”: How Men and Women Converse in Movies
## By Amira Mahmedjan and Sophia Pribus

This is a final project completed for DATASCI 112: Principles of Data Science class at Stanford University

There has been extensive research into whether men and women speak differently across different contexts. Our project sought to answer this question in the context of movie dialogue. We extracted data from Cornell Movie-Dialogs Corpus and analyzed how dialogue sentiments differ across different gender groupings over multiple decades. We found that: 
1. women have significantly higher dialogue sentiments;
2. sentiments of dialogue between same-gender speakers are significantly lower than between opposite-gender speakers.

We conclude that these speech sentiment differences have been consistent over time, which may stem from social implications related to gender and how we speak to in-group versus out-group people.
